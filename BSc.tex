\begin{abstract}
  This thesis studies the $Wtb$ vertex structure, using data ATLAS data from top
  quark decays, derived from $t\bar t$ events. The events are reconstructed with
  missing transverse momentum, single lepton decay and at least four jets where
  two of those jets are tagged as $b$ jets. The ATLAS Open Data, used in this
  thesis, was taken from $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $13$ TeV,
  which corresponds to a integrated luminosity of 10 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Angular
  asymmetries is used as the primary method for measuring the polarization of
  the $W$ bosons, with a novel approach of fitting Delphes $W$ polarization
  simulations to data taken from the ATLAS detector. The measured helicity
  fractions from Angular asymmetries are $F_0=0.634 \pm 0.016$,
  $F_L=0.339 \pm 0.009$ and $F_R=0.026 \pm 0.009$, with only statistical
  uncertainties considered, with angular asymmetries of $A_+ = 0.521 \pm 0.006$
  and $A_- = -0.828 \pm 0.006$, deviating slightly from the Standard Model.

\section{Introduction}
The standard model (SM) of particle physics is very successful at describing the
fundamental constituents of matter in our universe. Through experiments with
particle accelerators, many of the theoretical details in the SM has been
corroborated. To further test the theory larger accelerators are needed, which
led to the construction of the large hadron collider (LHC), finished in 2008.
Particles are collided together at high energy to probe the properties of the
produced debris, hoping to discover new physics that deviates from the SM.\\

The top quark was discovered in 1995, by experiments done by CDF~\cite{Abe_1995}
and DØ~\cite{Abachi_1995}. It is the heaviest known fundamental particle, with a
mass of $173.34 \pm 0.27 \pm 0.71 \mathrm{GeV/c^2}$, and its coupling strength
to all the bosons are well predicted by the standard model. Because of its heavy
mass and consequently short lifetime, it doesn't have enough time to bind with
lighter quarks and form hadrons before it decays, which means that it
effectively decays, to a good approximation, as a free quark. Measurements of
the top quark's properties plays an important role in testing the Standard
Model. Top quark production at LHC occurs via strong interactions, where they
are produced in top, anti-top pairs. One test of the Standard Model, is the
study of the $Wtb$ vertex Lorentz structure and coupling, which is studied by
looking at the decay products of top quarks. The top quarks decay, with almost
100\% branching fraction, by weak interactions into $W$ bosons and bottom quarks
$t \rightarrow W + b$. The $W$ bosons decay, into either a charged lepton and neutrino;
$W \rightarrow l + \nu_l$, or into a quark, anti-quark pair: $W \rightarrow q' + \bar{q}$, as
illustrated in the Feynman diagram Figure~\ref{fig:feynmandiagram}.\\

In this report, we are only looking at decays with a single lepton as decay
product. The leptons we look at are either electrons or muons, and the collision
will produce four jets, as evident from the diagram.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Standard Model}
The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory that describes three
of the four fundamental forces, (the electromagnetic force, the strong force and
the weak force), into a single theoretical framework. It contains all the known
elementary particles, and how these particles interact with the different
fields. The standard model manages to unify the electromagnetic (EM), and the
weak force into different aspects of the same force called the electroweak
force, while describing strong interactions through the framework of Quantum
Chromodynamics.\\

The elementary particles can be split into two distinct categories, called
fermions and bosons. Fermions are defined by their spin, which is a half odd
integer spin, but is exclusively $1/2$ for all the elementary fermions of the
Standard Model. They obey the pauli-exclusion principle which means that two
identical fermions can't occupy the same quantum state. The fermions are grouped
into quarks and leptons, each with three generations or families based on their
masses. All of the fermions have an antiparticle associated with them, each with
opposite charge, and apart from these antiparticle partners, there are a total
of twelve known fermions, two leptons and two quarks in each family. The quarks
that pair together in each generation are; the up and down quark, the charm and
strange quark, and the top and bottom quark. The leptons, electron, muon and
tau, each pair together with a neutrally charged neutrino.\\

In the SM, the fermions interact via gauge bosons, integer spin particles, which
include the photon, gluon, $W$- and $Z$-boson, also called force carrier
particles of the: electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force
respectively. Quarks interact with the EM and the strong force, while leptons
interact only with the electroweak force. Because neutrinos are neutrally
charged, they will only interact via the weak force. Several unique features is
found in weak interactions, such as parity violation (P), violation of charge
conjugation (C), as well as a violation of the combined charge conjugation and
parity symmetry (CP). Weak interactions does obey the combination of charge
conjugation, parity, and time reversal symmetry.

\subsubsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}
Quantum chromo dynamics (QCD), is the theory of the strong interaction, which
binds the quarks together. In the year 1964, physicist Murray Gell-Mann and his
PhD student George Zweig, proposed that baryons and mesons could be explained by
the existence of smaller triplet particles\cite{GELLMANN1964214}. Since the
Pauli exclusion principle forbids any fermions from inhabiting the same state,
leading to the development of the concept of color in 1973\cite{FRITZSCH1973365}
by phycisists Harald Fritzsh, Heinrich Leutwyler and Murray Gell-mann,
suggesting that these quarks had additional conserved
quantum numbers, later named color charge.\\

In QCD, each quark is associated with a color charge that confines the quark via
the strong interaction to other quarks to make up a total color charge that is
neutral. While the color charge isn't physically related to actual colors, the
way they mix together, is analogous to the way we mix the colors green, red and
blue, as well as their anti colors, magenta, yellow and cyan. Because of these
properties, quarks can bind together in groups with odd number of quarks with
at least three to form baryons, or an even number of at least two to form mesons.\\

If enough energy is added to stretch one of the quarks away from the rest, the
gluon field breaks, and a new quark and anti quark pair is created. This process
of creating new quark, anti quark pairs, by stretching the gluon field between
them is the result of violent inelastic collisions, which creates these jets of
quarks, anti quarks.\\

\subsubsection{Symmetries and Laws of Conservation}
In the year 1971, Emmy Noether showed that any conservation law is associated
with a continues symmetry of the Lagrangian\cite{Noether_1971}. The
conservation laws of classical physics are the result of them being invariant
with respect to their canonically conjugate quantities. The conservation of
energy, linear momentum and angular momentum, stems from their invariance in
time, space and angles respectively. This implies that the laws of physics are
independent of the time, the location and the orientation in space.\\

Another symmetry, that is very important for quantum mechanics, is the
reflection symmetry, called parity. A wave function can have positive or
negative parity depending on whether or not it changes sign under parity
transformation. For the laws which are invariant under reflection in space, the
parity quantum number $P$ is conserved, while in relativistic quantum mechanic,
we need to ascribe an intrinsic parity to particles and antiparticles.\\

Group theory gives the tools to study these symmetries more elegantly, and has
become particularly useful to describe symmetries of quantum mechanics, where
degenerate eigenstates furnishes irreducible representations of a group. In
studying these groups, we can discover other conserved quantities in the
interactions of the EM, the weak or the strong force.\\

The unitary group U(1), leads to conservation of charge in EM and strong
interactions, as well as the conservation of lepton number, as far as
we know in all interactions. Certain particles behave practically identically
with respect to the strong or the weak interactions, these properties are
studied through irreducible representations of the group SU(3), and are
characterized by strong and weak isospin, which are also conserved.\\

The Dirac equation extends the Schrödinger wave equations, to include the
effects of special relativity. The solution to this equation shows that for
relativistic particles, where $\beta = v/c \rightarrow 1$, the projection of a particle's spin
onto the direction of their momentum is conserved. This conserved quantity is
called helicity\cite[63]{Povh2015} and is defined as

\begin{equation}
  h = \frac{\vb{s \cdot p}}{\abs{\vb s} \cdot \abs{\vb p}},
\end{equation}

where $\vb s$ is the  spin, and $\vb p$ is the momentum of the particle. For
spin 1 particles, the Gauge bosons, the particle can take on three distinct
helicity values, $h=-1$, $h=0$ and $h=1$, which corresponds to left handed,
longtitudinal and right handed respectively.\\

Chirality is a fundamental property of a particle determined by representation
theory. In the relativistic limit the distinction between helicity and chirality
disappears, as the mass term $mc^2$ becomes negligible compared to the total
energy. The weak force will only interact with left-chiral particles and
right-chiral antiparticles. The operator of an interaction that describes the
exchange of a boson, can have both vector $V$ and axial vector $A$ nature. If it
has both a vector and an axial part, as in the case of weak interactions, parity
is violated, while maximum parity violation occurs when both the contributions
becomes equal magnitude.\\

After the discovery of parity violation and charge conjugation, by physicist C.S
Wu\cite{PhysRev.105.1413}, it was believed by physicists that CP-symmetry, the
combination of charge conjugation symmetry and parity, was a true symmetry of
the Standard model, until that too was violated in weak decay of neutral kaons,
forcing physicists to reformulate the electroweak interaction in the Standard
Model. The Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix explains how the flavour
eigenstates of the quarks are related to the mass eigenstates, and is a $3 \times 3$
unitary matrix, with four independant parameters: three real angles and an
imaginary phase\cite[153]{Povh2015}. The imaginary phase gives rise to CP
violation, but the matrix preserves CPT symmetry.

\subsection{Momentum}

\subsubsection{Four-momentum}
The data collected in LHC collisions, allows us to reconstruct the 4-vector of
momentum for the involved particles. This 4-vector is a four component tensor,
made up of an ordinary 3-vector for relativistic momentum $\vb p$, and the
relativistic energy term, $E^2/c^2$, as its first component. Working in natural
units, where we set $c=1$, our 4-vector will be given as
\begin{equation}
p = \left(\begin{matrix} E^2 \\ \vb p \end{matrix} \right).
\end{equation}

The dot product of two 4-vectors is given by $p\cdot p' = E E' - \vb p \cdot \vb{p'}$,
where $\vb p \cdot \vb{p'}$ is the ordinary dot product of two 3-vector momentum.
From special relativity, we know that $E^2 - \abs{\vb p}^2 = m^2$, so from the
dot product, we get that $p^2 = m^2$. Other vector operations on a 4-vector is
similar to those same vector operations on a 3-vector. The quantity
\begin{equation}
s = (p + p')^2 = (E + E')^2 - (\vb p + \vb p')^2
\end{equation}

is conserved, and is the center-of-mass energy squared of the system. It is the
energy available to create new particles, or probing the properties of
particles.

\subsubsection{Transverse Momentum}\label{sec:transmomentum}
In LHC experiments, the protons gets smashed together in head-on collisions at
nearly the speed of light. Since the protons momenentums are parallel to the
beam axis, conventionally defined as the $z$-axis their total momentum in the
$xy$-plane, the transverse momentum $p_T$, is zero. The jets scatter off in new
directions, at angles given by the polar angle $\theta$, and the azimuthal angle $\varphi$.
The polar angle is defined as the angle of the jet, with respect to the
$z$-axis, in the $xz$-plane, while the azimuthal angle is defined as the angle
of the jet, with respect to the $x$-axis in the $xy$-plane, as seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:momentum}.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The figure shows the momentum traveling parallel to the beam axis, and
  the transverse momentum, each with their respective angles.\label{fig:momentum}}
\end{figure}

In cylindrical detectors, it is useful to use another magnitude called
pseudorapidity, which ranges from values between $(-\infty, \infty)$. Pseudorapidity is
related to the polar angle, and is defined as:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:pseudorapidity}
\eta = -\ln({\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}).
\end{align}

Not all particles are, or can be deteccted by the detectors, but their existence
is still well understood through the conservation of momentum. At $v \rightarrow c$, the
momentum $\abs{\vb p} \approx E$, and the missing transverse momentum $E_T^{miss}$ is
defined as the transverse momentum that is not detected by the detector, but
calculated as the momentum for which the total momentum will become
zero~cite{xabier}.

\subsection{Top Quarks}
The top quark is the third generation up-type quark in the SM, with a charge of
$+2/3 e$, and the greatest mass of all the known elementary particles. Top quark
has a weak two-body decay and its decay can be analyzed from the
Cabbibo-Kaboyashi-Maskawa matrix (CKM). The diagonal part of the CKM matrix,
shows quarks transition predominantly within their own family, with very little
deviation from unity. This is especially true for the top quark, where top
quarks decays into bottom quarks and $W$ bosons 99.8\% of the time. Because the
top quark decays as a free quark, we can use the polarization as an observable,
because its spin will be preserved in the decay product.\\

There are two primary mechanisms for the production of top quarks at the LHC, a
single top via weak interactions, or the pair production via the strong force.
The pair production of top quark is a QCD effect, which takes place by gluon
fusion $gg \rightarrow t\bar t$ and quark-antiquark annihilation $q\bar q \rightarrow t\bar t$. The
branching fraction of each of the pair production processes, is related to the
center-of-mass energy, for which gluon fusion dominates at the LHC at about 86\%
of the production\cite{dasilva2016quark}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Coupling of W$^+$tb}\label{sec:coupling}
The leptonic decay of the $W$-boson, can decay into either of the three leptonic
families, with nearly equal branching ratios. The $\tau$ lepton is also very
unstable and has too short a lifetime, so it does not get tagged in this thesis.
$\tau$-particles that decay by weak interaction into electrons, $\tau^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e$, or
muons, $\tau^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$, are tagged as part of the single lepton channel.\\

The $W$-boson couples only to left-handed fermions, or right handed
anti-fermions, giving $Wtb$ vortex a (V-A) structure. In the Standard Model we
expect that the $W$-boson and $b$-quark from top decay, arrange such that chiral
structure of the couple vertex is fulfilled. Because of parity violation, the
events with positive helicity (right polarized) gets suppressed, while events
with negative (left polarized) and longitudinal helicity dominates.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/w_polarization.png}
	\caption{The figure illustrates W-boson with negative, zero and positive
    helicity, corresponding to a left, longitudinal and right handed
    polarization. The right handed polarization will be heavily suppressed
    because of the (V-A) structure of the Wtb vertex.}\label{fig:polarization}
\end{figure}

The fraction of; longitudinally $F_0$, left $F_L$ or right $F_R$ polarized
$W-$bosons which are produced from top quark decay, we refer to as helicity
fractions. In the Standard Model we can determine these fractions with quantum
chromo dynamics, in next to next to leading order (NNLO) calculations to be
$F_0 = 0.687 \pm 0.005$, $F_L = 0.311 \pm 0.005$ and
$F_R = 0.0017 \pm 0.0001$\cite{Czarnecki_2010}. The experimental method to
extract these fractions is by studying the angular decay distribution of the
leptonic decay products of the top quark. The angular distribution is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\Gamma}\dv{\Gamma}{\cos \theta^*} = \frac{3}{8}(1-\cos \theta^*)^2 F_L +
  \frac{3}{4}\sin^2 \theta^* F_0 + \frac{3}{8}(1+\cos \theta^*)^2 F_R.
\end{equation}

Where $\theta^*$ is the helicity angle, which is defined as the angle between the
decayed lepton momentum direction, and the reversible momentum direction of the
$b$-quark decay from the same top quark, viewed from a reference frame with $W$
at rest\cite{PhysRevD.45.124}. From the 4-vectors of the lepton and $b$-jet, we
can find the $\cos \theta^*$ from the following expression:
\begin{equation}
  \cos \theta^*=\frac{p_l\cdot p_b-E_lE_b}{\abs{\vb{p_l}}\abs{\vb{p_b}}} \simeq \frac{2 M_{lb}^2}{m_t^2 - M_W^2} - 1, \label{eq:costheta}
\end{equation}

here $p_l$ and $p_b$ are the four momentum vectors of the lepton and the bottom
quark respectively. $M_{lb}$ is the invariant mass of the lepton and bottom
quark system. The dependence is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:distributions} for the
three distribution seperately, and for the SM, with the above mentioned NNLO
helicity fractions.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/angular_dist.png}
	\caption{The predicted $\cos \theta^{*}$ angular distribution for helicity
    fractions. The distributions for $F_{0}$, $F_{L}$ and $F_{R}$ are
    normalized, and are given by the blue, red and green line respectively. The
    black line is the sum of the three contributions, but with helicity
    fractions given according to SM predictions.}\label{fig:distributions}
\end{figure}

Another approach to obtaining the polarization states the $W$-bosons, is done by
counting the number of events with a specific $\cos \theta^*$, then use angular
asymmetries, $A_-$, and $A_+$, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:asymmetries}
  A_{\pm}=\frac{N(\cos \theta^* > z)-N(\cos \theta^* < z)}{N(\cos \theta^* > z)+N(\cos \theta^* < z)},
\end{equation}

with $z=\pm(1-2^{2/3})$, to choose asymmetries involving only dependence on
$F_0$ and $F_L$ for $A_+$, or $F_0$ and $F_R$ for $A_-$. The helicity fractions
for the $W$ boson, can then be obtained by,
\begin{align}
  F_R&=\frac{1}{1-\beta}+\frac{A_- - \beta A_+}{3\beta (1-\beta^2)},\\
  F_L&=\frac{1}{1-\beta}-\frac{A_+ - \beta A_-}{3\beta (1-\beta^2)},\\
  F_0&=-\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}+\frac{A_+ - A_-}{3\beta (1-\beta)},
\end{align}

where $\beta = 2^{1/3}-1$. The values for angular asymmetries is calculated in SM
NNLO as $A_+=0.537 \pm 0.004$ and
$A_-=-0.841 \pm 0.006$~\cite[24]{CastroNunesFiolhais:1544047}.

\subsection{LHC}
In the Large Hadron Collider, top quarks are mainly produced through violent
collisions of protons, causing gluon-gluon fusion, which produces top, anti-top
pairs $gg \rightarrow t\bar t$. The data used in this thesis, is from the 2016 run at LHC,
with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt s = 13 \mathrm{TeV}$, which corresponds
to an integrated luminosity of 10 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$\cite{oreach2020}. At these
energies, the protons are accelerated close to the speed of light before their
collisions in the ATLAS detector.\\

This process starts, when protons are generated from an ion source in the linear
accelerator, LINAC2, then gets injected into the LHC, through a series of
smaller synchrotron accelerators, as Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc} illustrates; Proton
Syncrotron Booster (PSB), Proton Syncrotron (PS) and Super Protron Synhrotron
(SPS)~\cite[135]{Evans_2008}. The LHC receives bunches from SPS, containing many
protons in each bunch, effectively increasing the cross-sectional area for
collisions to occur. In order to prevent energy loss due to synchrotron
radiation, the LHC was built to be the largest particle accelerator in the
world, which has allowed it to reach higher energies than other accelerators. At
these energies, more events happen inside the detector, described by the
following equation:
\begin{equation}
  N = \sigma \int L \dd t,
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of expected events, $\sigma$ is the cross-sectional area of
the events, and $\int L \dd t$ is the integrated luminosity.

\subsubsection{The Inner Detector}
The purpose of this component is to measure charge and momentum, including it's
direction, of the detected particle. It consists of three subcomponents.

The pixel detector consists of approximately 92 million electronic channels.

of particles containing a b-quark or for b-tagging jets. The pixel detector

The Semiconductor tracker is a silicon microstrip tracker consisting of 4088
two-sided modules and over 6 million readout strips. These readout strips are
distributed every $80\mathrm{\mu m}$ which allows recording of the position of
charged particles to an accuracy of $17\mathrm{\mu m}$

\paragraph{Transition Radiation Tracker.}
The transition radiation tracker is a drift tube tracker which consists of a
straw with 4mm diameter and 0.03mm diameter tungsten wire, coated with 0.5--0.7mm
gold. The tube is filled with a mixture of Xe, $\mathrm{CO_2}$ and
$\mathrm{O_2}$ gasses. When charged particles travel through the tube the gas gets ionized, which frees electrons from the gas that move to the gold wire. The negative charge %befrier det de elektroner som bevæger sig hen til guld ledningen, eller befrier den elektronerne, så de kan bevæge sig hen til guld ledningen?

Calorimeters measure the energy of particles by absorbing them. There are two
types of calorimeters used in the ATLAS detector; the Electromagnetic
Calorimeter (ECal) and Hadronic Calorimeter (HCal). ECal measures charged
particles and photons.
%Maybe Expand

The HCal consist of scintillator plates that radiates light when exposed to a
charged particle. When a hadron passes through a scintillator plate it produces
a shower of particles which then makes the scintillator radiate light. The
intensity of the radiated light can then be analysed to measure the energy of
the hadron.


\subsubsection{Muon Spectrometer}

% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS_experiment#Muon_Spectrometer

The muon spectrometer is on the outer part of the ATLAS detector it operates in
the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 2.7$. Muons usually pass through the inner
detector and the calorimeters undetected, which is why the muon spectrometer is
located on the outside as other particles will have been stopped earlier in the
detector. The muon spectrometer consists of tubes, much like the transition
radiation tracker, that contains a gold wire which is surrounded by a gas. When
muons go through these tubes they interact with the gas and leave behind a trail
of ions and electrons which drift towards the gold wire in the centre. By
detecting the starting point of these trails, and measuring the time it takes to
reach the gold wire, it is possible to determine the position of the muon. The Muon Spectrometer can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:detector} \cite{ATLAS-Muon}


\subsubsection{Data Collection}
The detector generates 60 terabytes of data per second from the 1.7 billion
collisions taking place in the detector in that time frame. However, only some
of the raw data contains interesting characteristics. To make the data more %eks. på ændring: However, only a small sample of the raw data (is of interest / is necessary) to reconstruct the collisions
manageable ATLAS uses a two-level trigger system to only save the most important
data. The first part of the trigger system is hardware based, and can at most
save 100 000 events per second, which then gets passed on to the, software
based, High-Level Trigger. After passing through both triggers, only
approximately 1000 events out of the initial 1.7 billion are saved for later
analysis. \cite{ATLAS-trig}

ROOT is a framework used for storing and processing data in high energy physics. ROOT is primarily written in the programming language c++. Data in ROOT files are stored in a tree format, the file itself is a compressed binary file. \cite{root}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation}
%TODO 
%Omskriv til at inkludere pythia + POWHEG, delphes og ukendt opendata simuleringsværktøj
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used in modelling the signal and background
processes expected at the LHC.\@ For the 13 TeV Atlas Open Data used in this
thesis, this process follows four steps; starting with an event generation which
uses a MC generator to mimic the initial pp collision. In the second step,
detector simulation, the geometry of the ATLAS detector and its material
properties gets simulated. The digitisation step, follows the previous step by
simulating the responding signals in read-out data, written in a format
compatible with real output of the detector. Finally these data can be
used to reconstruct the collisions, particle trajectories and subsequent
products.\\

In The 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data set, there are several SM processes which are
modelled using MC simulations. For the purpose of this report, the MC
simulations on top-quark-pair production was used alongside real data taken from
the detector, to compare theory with real data~\cite{mcopenatlas}.
%Skal måske omskrives en smule, håber at i kan læse det igennem og se om der

\subsubsection{ROOT}
The function, which ROOT uses to construct the Lorentz vector, \texttt{SetPtEtaPhiE}, is defined as such,
\begin{equation}
  p({\vb p_t}, \eta, \phi, E) =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    |{\vb p_t}| \cos(\phi)\\ |{\vb p_t}|\sin(\phi)\\ |{\vb p_t}| \sinh(\eta)\\ E
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
To calculate the
transverse energy we are using the builtin ROOT \texttt{TLorentzVector} member
function \texttt{Et()}. That function is effectively defined as
\begin{equation}
  % {{{\it p\_t}\,\sqrt{{\it p\_y}^2+{\it p\_x}^2}}\over{\sqrt{ {\it p\_z}^2+{\it p\_y}^2+{\it p\_x}^2}}}
  E_t = p_t \frac{\sqrt{p_y^2+p_x^2}}{\sqrt{p_z^2+p_y^2+p_x^2}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Angular Asymmetries}
For measurements of angular asymmetries $A_{\pm}$ from eq \eqref{eq:asymmetries}, the $\cos\theta^{*}$ distribution was split into three non-uniform bins with events above and below $z_{\pm} = \pm(1-2^{\frac{2}{3}})$ given by; $N_1 = N(\cos \theta^{*}<z_-)$, $N_3 = N(\cos \theta^{*}>z_+)$ and $N_2$ being
the remaining events. Applying these parameters to the simulated data, correction factors $e_1$ and $e_3$ were obtained by comparing the simulated data to the Standard
Model expectation, then solving the system of equations obtained from \eqref{eq:asymmetries}. 

\begin{align}
	e_1 &= \frac{N_2(1+A_-)}{N_1(A_+-A_-)} = \num{1.515 +- 0.065E-2} \\ e_3 &= -\frac{N_2(A_+-1)}{N_3(A_+-A_-)} = \num{5.390 +- 0.081E-2}
\end{align}


\subsection{Template Method}
%draft
Pythia was used to generate three files containing left, longitudinal and right-handed polarizations of the W-boson separately. These files were then run through delphes, which simulates the ATLAS detector response and uses that to reconstruct the particles. Cuts were applied in ROOT matching the event selection criteria defined in section \ref{sec:cuts} to filter out background data. The templates were then combined and fitted to the real $\cos \theta^{*}$ distribution from the ATLAS detector, giving us the three helicity fractions $F_L$, $F_R$ and $F_0$.

\subsection{Event Selection}\label{sec:cuts}
In order to identify the top-quark-pair production, as seen in
figure~\ref{fig:feynmandiagram}, several cuts in the data were implemented. The
criteria are as follows~\cite{oreach2020}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only one electron or muon in the final state with $p_{T} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$
	\item Missing transverse momentum $E_{T}^{miss} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$
	\item Transverse mass of the W-boson $M_{T}^{W} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$
	\item At least four jets with $p_{T} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$, with exactly two of these being b-tagged
	\item Electrons are required to have $|\eta| < 2.47$ aside from $1.37 < |\eta| < 1.52$
	\item Muons are limited by $|\eta| < 2.50$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{B-tagging}
To study the $Wtb$ structure, a mechanism to identify the $b$-jets from the
other detected jets is required. First the jets are detected, $b$-hadrons,
$c$-hadrons or light-flavour jets, then their trajectories (tracks) are
reconstructed in the inner detector. Once a jet has been found, the jets
contining b-hadrons are then identified by a combination of three distinct
algorithms. Hadrons containing $b$-quarks have a long enough lifetime to fly a
measurable distance before it decays, and can be exploted to built
lifetime-based tagging algorithms. The impact parameter based algorithm, IP3D,
uses transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significances of each track
within a jet, the SV reconstructs the secondary vertex within the jet and decay
chain multi-vertex algorithm (JetFitter) reconstructs the full b-hadron
decay chain.\\

To better discriminate between jets, a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm
called MV2c10, which uses the Root Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis
(TMVA), is used to make cuts that discards most of the background components,
the $c$- and light-flavoured jets. For this report, a $b$-jet efficiency rate of
70\% is used, which corresponds to a BDT cut value of 0.8244. This efficiency
rate originates from samples of simulated $t\bar t$ events with a $c$- and
light-jet rejection factor of nearly 400\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-012}. At these
cuts, most of the $c$-jets and light-flavoured jets gets rejected, while still
maintaining most of the $b$-jet data.

%\subsubsection{Single Lepton Channel}

\subsection{Histograms from the ATLAS data}
Only a single lepton should be present in the events, after the identification
of the top-quark pair production. This allows the first lepton in the event to
be used as the leading lepton. Due to the nature of the decay, described in
Section~\ref{sec:coupling}, the tagged lepton can be either an electron or a
muon. This information is used in the construction of the Lorentz vector for the
lepton, from which the transverse momentum is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:leppt}.\\
% Wait, er det her ikke det samme da M er tæt på nul? Det er måske derfor de
% splitter electron muon. det kan være vi bare skal plotte noget andet eller vi
% kan jo selvfølgelig også bare gøre det samme som de gør ved at splitte
% electron/muon. Vi kan endda også bare plotte histogrammet med partikel id for
% at vise hvor mange af hver der er

    \caption{}
\end{figure*}

In the ATLAS Open Data, the reconstruction of the tracks, and calculation of the
transverse momentum of jets, is already given. The jets in the event are
ordered, which provides information about the leading jet simply by accessing
the first one. Good jets are decided on the requirements given in
Section~\ref{sec:cuts}, and the momentum plotted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:jetpt}. \\% also a requirement on pseudorapidity
% of the jets to be less than 2.5, however this should probably be mentioned in
% the criteria

The missing transverse energy, $E_T^{miss}$, is also given, calculated by
consideration of momentum conservation, in accordance with what is described in
Section~\ref{sec:transmomentum}. The missing transverse energy is then plotted
if the given event satisfies all the criteria given in Section~\ref{sec:cuts}.
The energy was plotted in the appropriate units in Figure~\ref{fig:etmiss}.\\

% maybe explain why maxing Pt gives the lower three jets but seems a bit
% obvious: if the b-jet in the upper part was in the combination it would
% subtract from the transverse momentum because it was produced from the top
% quark which has opposite momentum from the anti top quark.
The top quark mass can be calculated by finding the combination of three jets,
of which one is a bjet, with the highest transverse momentum, and taking the
mass of the whole three jet system. These three jets are the ones produced by
the the $\overline{t}$-quark in the lower part of the feynman diagram seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:feynmandiagram}.
% possible explanation why it works here (see comment above)
Once the top quark mass is found it can be plotted, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:topmass}. The peak of this histogram should then be compared to
the value from the standard model, which is $172.76 \pm 0.30$ GeV\cite{pdg}.

\subsection{$\cos \theta^{*}$ reconstruction}
Reconstruction of $\cos \theta^{*}$ from the data given in the Lorentz 4 vectors, was
accomplished by equation~\eqref{eq:costheta}. Since only two $b$-jets is tagged,
the $b$-jet associated with the leptonic decay was decided by the method of
exclusion, once the $b$-jet associated with the other jets was identified. The
reconstructed $\cos \theta^{*}$ is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:costhetaatlas} below.

% do we differentiate between them by S_z value
\subsection{Delphes data}
Before the criteria from Section~\ref{sec:cuts} were applied to the Delphes
data, a sanity check was performed on the generated truth data, to assess
whether it matches with the theoretical analytical function plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:distributions}. The three plots are displayed below for each of
the three polarizations in Figures~\ref{fig:delphesdist}.\\

\end{figure*}

To reconstruct the helicity distributions which would be found from
measurements, the criteria performed on the ATLAS data, from
Section~\ref{sec:cuts}, were matched on the Delphes data, to isolate the
equivalent usable data, gotten from the ATLAS detector. The
Figures~\ref{fig:redelphesdist} shows the three helicity distrubutions after the
cuts.

\section{Discussion}
% TODO:
% Beskriv hvordan vi bruger angular asymmetries til korrektion
% Nævn delphes efficiency efter cuts 800/20000 eller whatever
% Skriv om delphes scatterplot når den er sat ind i data analysis
% Error propagation
Due to the limitations of the released 13 TeV Open Datasets, it was not possible
to analyse the helicity fractions' angular distributions through the ATLAS data,
which lead to the utilization of Delphes. The deviation between the predicted SM
values for the helicity fraction, and the value obtained through the fitting, is
possibly the result of systematic errors when attempting to fit Delphes
simulated spin orientation, to the data obtained from the LHC Open ATLAS run in
2016. Since Delphes runs a fast-simulation, it is not designed to be used in
parallel with data taken from advanced detector studies. This analysis
consequently serves as a test for this novel approach of combining Delphes
simulations with data taken from ATLAS detector. While similar cuts was
attempted to be implemented on the Delphes' truth-information, due to the
absence of the b-tagging MV2c10 algorithm in Delphes, cuts were made using
80--85\% efficiency instead~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-11-004}.\\

However, perhaps the greatest source of errors is a consequence of statistical
errors, due to the small event samples surviving the cut on the given Delphes
data, an efficiency of less than 1/20. Figure~\ref{fig:scatterplot} illustrates
the effect of the cuts on the truth data, where the normalized data of
Fig.~\ref{fig:delphesdist}, is plotted out of one axis, and the data from
Fig.~\ref{fig:redelphesdist} is plotted out of the other. The values for the
reconstructed left and right handed distributions diverge from the truth values,
at values with higher density of events, corresponding to the corners of the
truth distribution. As a result of time constraints, and the large storage space
required to simulate a sufficient number of Delphes events, information about
the $W$ polarization was instead obtained by the method of angular asymmetries,
described in Section~\ref{sec:coupling}.\\

%For measurements of angular asymmetries, three parameters were
%considered; $N1 = N(\cos \theta^{*}<z_-)$, $N3 = N(\cos \theta^{*}>z_+)$ and $N2$ being
%the remaining events. Applying these parameters to the simulated data, the
%correction factors were obtained by comparing the simulated data to the Standard
%Model expectation, then solving a system of equation.

For measurements of angular asymmetries, the error was found, using first order
error propagation on equation~\eqref{eq:asymmetries}. The statistical error of
this approach, was significantly smaller, due to the fact that the data was
taken exclusively from the Open ATLAS Data, which had a much larger data sample
than the Delphes simulations.\\

The reconstructed $\cos \theta^*$, from the ATLAS data, used in both methods, had
significant entries in overflow. The theoretical $\cos \theta^*$ was compared to the
the approximation, but no significant differences appeared between the two,
refuting the possibility that overflow stemmed from the approximation. This %ved ikke om vi overhovedet bør nævne det med den sammenligningen.
overflow was ignored in the fitting process, as only data remaining within the
physically possible range from -1 to 1, was considered in the analysis. The
Delphes data for the helicity destributions, had substantially less overflow,
than data from Open ATLAS, which also motived the decision to only fit within the
parameter -1 to 1.

%Kan godt være at jeg skal lave nogle ændringer på diskussionen, med de nye
%data, og med fokus på den nye tilgangs metode.

\section{Conclusion}
A measurement of the polarization of $W$ bosons, from top quark pair events
decay to single lepton channels, was presented using data collected from Open
ATLAS $pp$ cikkusuibs at $\sqrt s = 13$TeV, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 10 fb$^{-1}$. The helicity fractions obtained from angular
asymmetries are $F_0=0.634 \pm 0.016$, $F_L=0.339 \pm 0.009$ and
$F_R=0.026 \pm 0.009$. Due to the limitations of the Open Atlas
Data~\cite{oreach2020}, only statistical uncertainties were considered, leaving
the possibility of larger systematic uncertainties. The measured helicity
fractions deviated slightly from the SM expectation values, but this could be
the result of lack in systematic uncertainties, or discarding the overflow.
