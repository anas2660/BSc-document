\begin{abstract}
  This thesis studies the $Wtb$ vertex structure, using data ATLAS data from top
  quark decays, derived from $t\bar t$ events. The events are reconstructed with
  missing transverse momentum, single lepton decay and at least four jets where
  two of those jets are tagged as $b$ jets. The ATLAS Open Data, used in this
  thesis, was taken from $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $13$ TeV,
  which corresponds to a integrated luminosity of 10 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Angular
  asymmetries is used as the primary method for measuring the polarization of
  the $W$ bosons, with a novel approach of fitting Delphes $W$ polarization
  simulations to data taken from the ATLAS detector. The measured helicity
  fractions from Angular asymmetries are $F_0=0.695 \pm 0.015$,
  $F_L=0.297 \pm 0.008$ and $F_R=0.007 \pm 0.009$, with only statistical
  uncertainties considered, with angular asymmetries of $A_+ = 0.550 \pm 0.006$
  and $A_- = -0.834 \pm 0.007$, in agreement with the Standard Model.

\section{Introduction}
The standard model (SM) of particle physics is very successful at describing the
fundamental constituents of matter in our universe. Through experiments with
particle accelerators, many of the theoretical details in the SM has been
corroborated. To further test the theory larger accelerators are needed, which
led to the construction of the large hadron collider (LHC), finished in 2008.
Particles are collided together at high energy to probe the properties of the
produced debris, hoping to discover new physics that deviates from the SM.\\

The top quark was discovered in 1995, by experiments done by CDF~\cite{Abe_1995}
and DØ~\cite{Abachi_1995}. It is the heaviest known fundamental particle, with a
mass of $172.76 \pm 0.30 \mathrm{GeV/c^2}$~\cite{pdg}, and its coupling
strength to all the bosons are well predicted by the standard model. Because of
its heavy mass and consequently short lifetime, it doesn't have enough time to
bind with lighter quarks and form hadrons before it decays, which means that it
effectively decays, to a good approximation, as a free quark. Measurements of
the top quark's properties plays an important role in testing the Standard
Model. Top quark production at LHC occurs via strong interactions, where they
are produced in top, anti-top pairs. One test of the Standard Model, is the
study of the $Wtb$ vertex Lorentz structure and coupling, which is studied by
looking at the decay products of top quarks. The top quarks decay, with almost
100\% branching fraction, by weak interactions into $W$ bosons and bottom quarks
$t \rightarrow W + b$. The $W$ bosons decay, into either a charged lepton and neutrino;
$W \rightarrow l + \nu_l$, or into a quark, anti-quark pair: $W \rightarrow q' + \bar{q}$, as
illustrated in the Feynman diagram Figure~\ref{fig:feynmandiagram}.\\

In this report, we are only looking at decays with a single lepton as decay
product. The leptons we look at are either electrons or muons, and the collision
will produce four jets, as evident from the diagram.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Standard Model}
The Standard Model is a relativistic quantum field theory that describes three
of the four fundamental forces, (the electromagnetic force, the strong force and
the weak force), into a single theoretical framework. It contains all the known
elementary particles, and how these particles interact with the different
fields. The standard model manages to unify the electromagnetic (EM), and the
weak force into different aspects of the same force called the electroweak
force, while describing strong interactions through the framework of Quantum
Chromodynamics.\\

The elementary particles can be split into two distinct categories, called
fermions and bosons. Fermions are defined by their spin, which is a half integer
spin, and is exclusively $1/2$ for all the elementary fermions of the Standard
Model. They obey the Pauli exclusion principle which means that two identical
fermions can't occupy the same quantum state. The fermions are grouped into
quarks and leptons, each with three generations or families based on their
masses. All the fermions have an antiparticle associated with them, each with
opposite charge, and apart from these antiparticle partners, there are a total
of twelve known fermions, two leptons and two quarks in each family. The quarks
that pair together in each generation are; the up and down quark, the charm and
strange quark, and the top and bottom quark. The leptons, electron, muon and
tau, each pair together with a neutrally charged neutrino.\\

In the SM, the fermions interact via gauge bosons, integer spin particles, which
include the photon, gluon, $W$- and $Z$-boson, also called force carrier
particles of the: electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force
respectively. Quarks interact with the EM and the strong force, while leptons
interact only with the electroweak force. Because neutrinos are neutrally
charged, they will only interact via the weak force. Several unique features is
found in weak interactions, such as parity violation (P), violation of charge
conjugation (C), as well as a violation of the combined charge conjugation and
parity symmetry (CP). Weak interactions do obey the combination of charge
conjugation, parity, and time reversal symmetry.

\subsubsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD), is the theory of the strong interaction, which
binds the quarks together. In the year 1964, physicist Murray Gell-Mann and his
PhD student George Zweig, proposed that baryons and mesons could be explained by
the existence of smaller triplet particles\cite{GELLMANN1964214}. Since the
Pauli exclusion principle forbids any fermions from inhabiting the same state,
leading to the development of the concept of color in 1973\cite{FRITZSCH1973365}
by physicists Harald Fritzsh, Heinrich Leutwyler and Murray Gell-mann,
suggesting that these quarks had additional conserved
quantum numbers, later named color charge.\\

In QCD, each quark is associated with a color charge that confines the quark via
the strong interaction to other quarks to make up a total color charge that is
neutral. While the color charge isn't physically related to actual colors, the
way they mix together, is analogous to the way we mix the colors green, red and
blue, as well as their anti colors, magenta, yellow and cyan. Because of these
properties, quarks can bind together in groups of three to form baryons, or in
groups of two to form mesons.\\

If enough energy is added to stretch one of the quarks away from the rest, the
gluon field breaks, and a new quark and anti quark pair is created. This process
of creating new quark, anti quark pairs, by stretching the gluon field between
them is the result of violent inelastic collisions, which creates these jets of
quarks, anti quarks.\\

\subsubsection{Symmetries and Laws of Conservation}
In the year 1918, Emmy Noether showed that any conservation law is associated
with a continues symmetry of the Lagrangian\cite{Noether_1971}. The
conservation laws of classical physics are the result of them being invariant
with respect to their canonically conjugate quantities. The conservation of
energy, linear momentum and angular momentum, stems from their invariance in
time, space and angles respectively. This implies that the laws of physics are
independent of the time, the location and the orientation in space.\\

Another symmetry, that is very important for quantum mechanics, is the
reflection symmetry, called parity. A wave function can have positive or
negative parity depending on whether or not it changes sign under parity
transformation. For the laws which are invariant under reflection in space, the
parity quantum number $P$ is conserved, while in relativistic quantum mechanic,
we need to ascribe an intrinsic parity to particles and antiparticles.\\

Group theory gives the tools to study these symmetries more elegantly, and has
become particularly useful to describe symmetries of quantum mechanics, where
degenerate eigenstates furnishes irreducible representations of a group. In
studying these groups, we can discover other conserved quantities in the
interactions of the EM, the weak or the strong force.\\

The Gauge invariance of the unitary group U(1), leads to conservation of
electric charge, as well as the conservation of lepton number. Lepton number
conservation is, far as we know, conserved in all interactions. Certain
particles behave practically identically with respect to the strong or the weak
interactions, these properties are studied through irreducible representations
of the group SU(3), and are characterized by strong and weak isospin, which are
also conserved.\\

The Dirac equation extends the Schrödinger wave equations, to include the
effects of special relativity. The solution to this equation shows that for
relativistic particles, where $\beta = v/c \rightarrow 1$, the projection of a particle's spin
onto the direction of their momentum is conserved. This conserved quantity is
called helicity\cite[63]{Povh2015} and is defined as
\begin{equation}
  h = \frac{\vb{s \cdot p}}{\abs{\vb s} \cdot \abs{\vb p}},
\end{equation}
where $\vb s$ is the spin, and $\vb p$ is the momentum of the particle. For
spin 1 particles, the Gauge bosons, the particle can take on three distinct
helicity values, $h=-1$, $h=0$ and $h=1$, which corresponds to left-handed,
longitudinal and right-handed respectively.\\

Chirality is a fundamental property of a particle determined by representation
theory. In the relativistic limit the distinction between helicity and chirality
disappears, as the mass term $mc^2$ becomes negligible compared to the total
energy. The weak force will only interact with left-chiral particles and
right-chiral antiparticles. The operator of an interaction that describes the
exchange of a boson, can have both vector $V$ and axial vector $A$ nature. If it
has both a vector and an axial part, as in the case of weak interactions, parity
is violated, and maximum parity violation occurs when both the contributions
becomes equal magnitude, which is true for (V-A) structures..\\

After the discovery of parity violation and charge conjugation, in weak
interactions, by physicist C.S Wu\cite{PhysRev.105.1413}, it was believed by
physicists that CP-symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation symmetry and
parity, was a true symmetry of the Standard model, until that too was violated
in weak decay of neutral kaons, forcing physicists to reformulate the
electroweak interaction in the Standard Model. The Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) matrix explains how the flavour eigenstates of the quarks are related to
the mass eigenstates, and is a $3 \times 3$ unitary matrix, with four independent
parameters: three real angles and an imaginary phase\cite[153]{Povh2015}. The
imaginary phase gives rise to CP violation, but the matrix preserves CPT
symmetry.

\subsection{Momentum}\label{sec:momentum}

\subsubsection{Four-momentum}
The data collected in LHC collisions, allows us to reconstruct the 4-vector of
momentum for the involved particles, the Lorentzvector. This 4-vector is a four
component tensor, made up of an ordinary 3-vector for relativistic momentum
$\vb p$, and the relativistic energy term, $E/c$, as its first component.
Working in natural units, where $c=1$, the 4-vector will be given as
\begin{equation}
p = \left(\begin{matrix} E \\ \vb p \end{matrix} \right).
\end{equation}

The dot product of two 4-vectors is defined for this Lorentzvector as;
$p\cdot p' = E E' - \vb p \cdot \vb{p'}$, where $\vb p \cdot \vb{p'}$ is the ordinary dot
product of two 3-vector momentum vectors. From special relativity, it is known
that $E^2 - \abs{\vb p}^2 = m^2$, so from the 4-vector dot product of two
identical 4-vectors, the following holds true $p^2 = m^2$. Other vector
operations on a 4-vector is similar to the same vector operations on a
3-vector. The quantity
\begin{equation}
s = (p + p')^2 = (E + E')^2 - (\vb p + \vb p')^2
\end{equation}
is a conserved quantity, the center-of-mass energy squared of the system. It is
the square of the collision energy, which allows the creation of new particles,
and allows the probing of particle properties.

\subsubsection{Transverse Momentum}\label{sec:transmomentum}
In LHC experiments, the protons gets smashed together in head-on collisions at
nearly the speed of light. Since the protons momenta are parallel to the beam
axis, conventionally defined as the $z$-axis, their total momentum in the
$xy$-plane, the transverse momentum $\vb p_T$, is zero. The jets scatter off in
new directions, at angles given by the polar angle $\theta$, and the azimuthal angle
$\varphi$. The polar angle is defined as the angle of the jet, with respect to the
$z$-axis, while the azimuthal angle is defined as the angle of the jet, with
respect to the $x$-axis in the $xy$-plane, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:momentum}.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The figure shows the momentum traveling parallel to the beam axis, and
  the transverse momentum, each with their respective angles.\label{fig:momentum}}
\end{figure}

In cylindrical detectors, it is useful to use another magnitude called
pseudorapidity, which ranges from values between $(-\infty, \infty)$. Pseudorapidity is
related to the polar angle, and is defined as:

\begin{align}
\label{eq:pseudorapidity}
\eta = -\ln({\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}).
\end{align}

In particle collisions, the longitudinal momenta of the colliding elementary
gluons and quarks are unknown. These carry an unknown amount of the protons'
momenta, where the remaining momentum disappears into the beam tube. To
reconstruct the jets' tracks, the transverse momentum is analysed, but not all
particles are detected by ATLAS, such as the small neutrally charged neutrinos,
their existence is understood by the conservation of momentum. The missing
transverse momentum $E_T^{miss}$ is defined as the transverse momentum that is
not detected by the detector, but calculated as the momentum for which the total
momentum of the system will add to zero~\cite{xabier}.

\subsection{Top Quarks}
The top quark is the third generation up-type quark in the SM, with a charge of
$+2/3 e$, and the greatest mass of all the known elementary particles. Top quark
has a weak two-body decay and its decay can be analysed from the
Cabbibo-Kaboyashi-Maskawa matrix (CKM). The diagonal part of the CKM matrix,
shows quarks transition predominantly within their own family, with very little
deviation from unity. This is especially true for the top quark, where top
quarks decays into bottom quarks and $W$ bosons 99.8\% of the time. Because the
top quark decays as a free quark, we can use the polarization as an observable,
because its spin will be preserved in the decay product.\\

There are two primary mechanisms for the production of top quarks at the LHC, a
single top via weak interactions, or the pair production via the strong force.
The pair production of top quark is a QCD effect, which takes place by gluon
fusion $gg \rightarrow t\bar t$ and quark-antiquark annihilation $q\bar q \rightarrow t\bar t$. The
branching fraction of each of the pair production processes, is related to the
center-of-mass energy, for which gluon fusion dominates at the LHC at about 86\%
of the production\cite{dasilva2016quark}.

    on the left, and $q\bar q \rightarrow t\bar t$ on the right. Both produciton
    mechanisms are results of strong interactions.}\label{fig:ttproduction}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Coupling of W$^+$tb}\label{sec:coupling}
The leptonic decay of the $W$-boson, can decay into either of the three leptonic
families, with nearly equal branching ratios. The $\tau$ lepton is also very
unstable and has too short a lifetime, so it does not get tagged in this thesis.
$\tau$-particles that decay by weak interaction into electrons,
$\tau^+ \rightarrow e^+ \nu_e \bar \nu_{\tau}$, or muons, $\tau^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu \bar \nu_{\tau}$, are tagged as part of
the single lepton channel.\\

The $W$-boson couples only to left-handed fermions, or right-handed
anti-fermions, giving $Wtb$ vortex a (V-A) structure. In the Standard Model we
expect that the $W$-boson and $b$-quark from top decay, arrange such that chiral
structure of the coupled vertex is fulfilled. Because of parity violation, the
events with positive helicity (right polarized) gets suppressed, while events
with negative (left polarized) and longitudinal helicity dominates. The three
polarizations are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization}, where, in this
hyper relativistic limit the $b$ quark can, to a good approximaiton,
$m_t >> m_b$, always be considered left handed, which necessitates that the $W$
boson is either longitudinal or right handed.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/w_polarization.png}
	\caption{The figure illustrates W-boson with negative, zero and positive
    helicity, corresponding to a left, longitudinal and right handed
    polarization. The right handed polarization will be heavily suppressed
    because of the (V-A) structure of the Wtb vertex.}\label{fig:polarization}
\end{figure}

The fraction of; longitudinally $F_0$, left $F_L$ or right $F_R$ polarized
$W$-bosons which are produced from top quark decay, is referred to as helicity
fractions. In the Standard Model these fractions are calculated using quantum
chromodynamics. In leading order calculations, using the $m_b = 0$ limit, the
fractions are determined by the folllowing relations; $F_0/F_L = (m_t/m_W)^2$
and $F_R = 0 \Rightarrow F_0 + F_L = 1$, corresponding to the helicity fractions;

\begin{align}
\label{eq:helfrac}
  F_0 &= \frac{m_t^2}{m_t^2 + 2 m_W^2} \approx 0.7\\
  F_L &= \frac{2 m_W^2}{m_t^2 + 2 m_W^2} \approx 0.3\\
  F_R &= 0
\end{align}

For further corrections, these fractions are found in next to next to leading
order (NNLO) calculations to be $F_0 = 0.687 \pm 0.005$, $F_L = 0.311 \pm 0.005$
and $F_R = 0.0017 \pm 0.0001$\cite{Czarnecki_2010}. The experimental method to
extract these fractions is by studying the angular decay distribution of the
leptonic decay products of the top quark. The angular distribution is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\Gamma}\dv{\Gamma}{\cos \theta^*} = \frac{3}{8}(1-\cos \theta^*)^2 F_L +
  \frac{3}{4}\sin^2 \theta^* F_0 + \frac{3}{8}(1+\cos \theta^*)^2 F_R.
\end{equation}

Where $\theta^*$ is the helicity angle, which is defined as the angle between the
charged lepton momentum direction, and the reversed momentum direction of the
decayed $b$ quark, viewed from a reference frame with $W$ at
rest~\cite{PhysRevD.45.124}. An expression for $\cos \theta^*$ can be found, using
the dot product of the two four-momentum vectors, the lepton $p_l$ and $b$ quark
$p_b$; $p_l\cdot p_b=E_bE_l-\vb{p_l\cdot p_b}=E_bE_l+\abs{\vb{p_l}}\abs{\vb{p_b}}\cos \theta^*$,
where the $\cos{(\theta^{*}-\pi)}=-\cos \theta^{*}$ was used to flip the sign.
$\cos \theta^{*}$ is then given by;


\begin{equation}
  \cos \theta^*=\frac{p_l\cdot p_b-E_lE_b}{\abs{\vb{p_l}}\abs{\vb{p_b}}}\\
  \simeq -\frac{p_l\cdot p_b}{E_lE_b} - 1 = \frac{2 M_{lb}^2}{m_t^2 - M_W^2} - 1. \label{eq:costheta}
\end{equation}
Where $M_{lb}$ is the invariant mass of the lepton and bottom quark system. The
approximation arises from the relativistic assumption that the masses of the
lepton and $b$ quark can be neglected so that
$E_lE_b\simeq \abs{\vb{p_l}}\abs{\vb{p_b}}$. The dependence is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:distributions} for the three distribution separately, and for the
SM, with the above-mentioned NNLO helicity fractions.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/angular_dist.png}
	\caption{The predicted $\cos \theta^{*}$ angular distribution for helicity
    fractions. The distributions for $F_{0}$, $F_{L}$ and $F_{R}$ are
    normalized, and are given by the blue, red and green line respectively. The
    black line is the sum of the three contributions, but with helicity
    fractions given according to SM predictions.}\label{fig:distributions}
\end{figure}

An approach to obtaining the polarization states the $W$-bosons, is done by
counting the number of events with a specific $\cos \theta^*$, then use angular
asymmetries, $A_-$, and $A_+$, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:asymmetries}
  A_{\pm}=\frac{N(\cos \theta^* > z)-N(\cos \theta^* < z)}{N(\cos \theta^* > z)+N(\cos \theta^* < z)},
\end{equation}
where $z=\pm(1-2^{2/3})$, is chosen that the asymmetries only has dependence on
$F_0$ and $F_L$ for $A_+$, or $F_0$ and $F_R$ for $A_-$. From
equation~\eqref{eq:asymmetries}, the helicity can be extracted using the
following approach;
\begin{align}
\label{eq:asymmetriesplus}
  A_+ &= \int^1_{z_+} \frac{1}{\Gamma}\dv{\Gamma}{\cos \theta^*} \dd{\cos \theta^{*}} - \int^{z_+}_{-1}
      \frac{1}{\Gamma}\dv{\Gamma}{\cos \theta^*} \dd{\cos \theta^{*}} = 3\beta [F_0 + (1+\beta)F_R],\\
\label{eq:asymmetriesminus}
  A_- &= \int^1_{z_-} \frac{1}{\Gamma}\dv{\Gamma}{\cos \theta^*} \dd{\cos \theta^{*}} - \int^{z_-}_{-1}
      \frac{1}{\Gamma}\dv{\Gamma}{\cos \theta^*} \dd{\cos \theta^{*}} = -3\beta [F_0 + (1+\beta)F_L],
\end{align}
where $\beta = 2^{1/3}-1$. From the
equations~\eqref{eq:asymmetriesplus},~\eqref{eq:asymmetriesminus} and
$F_L+F_0+F_R=1$, the following helicity fractions for the $W$ boson is obtained;
\begin{align}
  F_R&=\frac{1}{1-\beta}+\frac{A_- - \beta A_+}{3\beta (1-\beta^2)},\\
  F_L&=\frac{1}{1-\beta}-\frac{A_+ - \beta A_-}{3\beta (1-\beta^2)},\\
  F_0&=-\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}+\frac{A_+ - A_-}{3\beta (1-\beta)}.
\end{align}
The values for angular asymmetries is calculated in SM
NNLO as $A_+=0.537 \pm 0.004$ and
$A_-=-0.841 \pm 0.006$~\cite[24]{CastroNunesFiolhais:1544047}.

\section{Apparatus}
\subsection{LHC}
In the Large Hadron Collider, top quarks are mainly produced through violent
collisions of protons, causing gluon-gluon fusion, which produces top, anti-top
pairs $gg \rightarrow t\bar t$. The data used in this thesis, is from the 2016 run at LHC,
with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt s = 13 \mathrm{TeV}$, which corresponds
to an integrated luminosity of 10 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$\cite{oreach2020}. At these
energies, the protons are accelerated close to the speed of light before their
collisions in the ATLAS detector.\\

This process starts, when protons are generated from an ion source in the linear
accelerator, LINAC2, then gets injected into the LHC, through a series of
smaller synchrotron accelerators, as Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc} illustrates; Proton
Synchrotron Booster (PSB), Proton Synchrotron (PS) and Super Proton Syncrotron
(SPS)~\cite[135]{Evans_2008}. The LHC receives bunches from SPS, containing many
protons in each bunch, effectively increasing the cross-sectional area for
collisions to occur. The LHC was built to be the largest particle accelerator in the
world, which has allowed it to reach higher energies than other accelerators. At
these energies, more events happen inside the detector, described by the
following equation:
\begin{equation}
  N = \sigma \int L \dd t,
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of expected events, $\sigma$ is the cross-sectional area of
the events, and $\int L \dd t$ is the integrated luminosity.

The ATLAS detector consists of multiple primary components, each with their own
subcomponents or subsections.

\subsubsection{The Inner Detector}
The purpose of this component is to measure charge and momentum, including its
direction, of the detected particle. It consists of three subcomponents. 
\paragraph{Pixel Detector}
% https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/3/07/P07007
The pixel detector consists of approximately 92 million electronic channels.
It's used for identification and reconstruction of secondary vertices from decay
of particles containing a b-quark or for b-tagging jets. The pixel detector
covers pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 2.5 $
% Og mange flere kriterier relevant? 

\paragraph{Semiconductor Tracker}
%https://cds.cern.ch/record/1019885/files/indet-pub-2007-007.pdf
The Semiconductor tracker is a silicon microstrip tracker consisting of 4088
two-sided modules and over 6 million readout strips. These readout strips are
distributed every $80\mathrm{\mu m}$ which allows recording of the position of
charged particles to an accuracy of $17\mathrm{\mu m}$

\paragraph{Transition Radiation Tracker.}
The transition radiation tracker is a drift tube tracker which consists of a
straw with 4mm diameter and 0.03mm diameter tungsten wire, coated with 0.5--0.7mm
gold. The tube is filled with a mixture of Xe, $\mathrm{CO_2}$ and
$\mathrm{O_2}$ gasses. When charged particles travel through the tube the gas
gets ionized, which frees electrons from the gas that move to the gold wire. The
negative charge measured on the wire can be used to distinguish which charged
particle ionized the gas. \cite{ATLAS-ID}


\subsubsection{Calorimeter}
% TODO
% Maybe Expand ECal
Calorimeters measure the energy of particles by absorbing them. There are two
types of calorimeters used in the ATLAS detector; the Electromagnetic
Calorimeter (ECal) and Hadronic Calorimeter (HCal). ECal measures charged
particles and photons.


The HCal consist of scintillator plates that radiates light when exposed to a
charged particle. When a hadron passes through a scintillator plate it produces
a shower of particles which then makes the scintillator radiate light. The
intensity of the radiated light can then be analysed to measure the energy of
the hadron. \cite{detector-vid}


\subsubsection{Muon Spectrometer}
% https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/TP/NEW/HTML/tp9new/node11.html#SECTION00434000000000000000
% https://atlas.cern/discover/detector/muon-spectrometer
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATLAS_experiment#Muon_Spectrometer

The muon spectrometer is on the outer part of the ATLAS detector it operates in
the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 2.7$. Muons usually pass through the inner
detector and the calorimeters undetected, which is why the muon spectrometer is
located on the outside as other particles will have been stopped earlier in the
detector. The muon spectrometer consists of tubes, much like the transition
radiation tracker, that contains a gold wire which is surrounded by a gas. When
muons go through these tubes they interact with the gas and leave behind a trail
of ions and electrons which drift towards the gold wire in the centre. By
detecting the starting point of these trails, and measuring the time it takes to
reach the gold wire, it is possible to determine the position of the muon. The
Muon Spectrometer can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:detector} \cite{ATLAS-Muon}


\subsubsection{Data Collection}
The detector generates 60 terabytes of data per second from the 1.7 billion
collisions taking place in the detector in that time frame. However, only a
small sample of the raw data is necessary to reconstruct the collisions. To make
the data more manageable ATLAS uses a two-level trigger system to only save the
most important data. The first part of the trigger system is hardware based, and
can at most save 100 000 events per second, which then gets passed on to the
software based High-Level Trigger. After passing through both triggers, only
approximately 1000 events out of the initial 1.7 billion are saved for later
analysis.\cite{ATLAS-trig}



\subsection{ROOT}
ROOT is a framework used for storing and processing data in high energy physics.
ROOT is primarily written in the programming language c++. Data in ROOT files
are stored in a tree format, the file itself is a compressed binary
file.\cite{root}

\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulation}
%TODO 
%Omskriv til at inkludere pythia + POWHEG, delphes og ukendt opendata simuleringsværktøj
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used in modelling the signal and background
processes expected at the LHC.\@ For the 13 TeV Atlas Open Data used in this
thesis, this process follows four steps; starting with an event generation which
uses an MC generator to mimic the initial pp collision. In the second step,
detector simulation, the geometry of the ATLAS detector and its material
properties gets simulated. The digitization step, follows the previous step by
simulating the responding signals in read-out data, written in a format
compatible with real output of the detector. Finally, these data can be used to
reconstruct the collisions, particle trajectories and subsequent
products.\\

In The 13 TeV ATLAS Open Data set, there are several SM processes which are
modelled using MC simulations. For the purpose of this report, the MC
simulations on top-quark-pair production was used alongside real data taken from
the detector, to compare theory with real data~\cite{mcopenatlas}.
%Skal måske omskrives en smule, håber at i kan læse det igennem og se om der
%mangler noget.


\subsubsection{B-tagging}
To study the $Wtb$ structure, a mechanism to identify the $b$-jets from the
other detected jets is required. First the jets are detected, $b$-hadrons,
$c$-hadrons or light-flavour jets, then their trajectories (tracks) are
reconstructed in the inner detector. Once a jet has been found, the jets
containing b-hadrons are then identified by a combination of three distinct
algorithms. Hadrons containing $b$-quarks have a long enough lifetime to fly a
measurable distance before it decays, and can be exploited to built
lifetime-based tagging algorithms. The impact parameter based algorithm, IP3D,
uses transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significances of each track
within a jet, the SV reconstructs the secondary vertex within the jet and decay
chain multi-vertex algorithm (JetFitter) reconstructs the full b-hadron
decay chain.\\

To better discriminate between jets, a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm
called MV2c10, which uses the Root Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis
(TMVA), is used to make cuts that discards most of the background components,
the $c$- and light-flavoured jets. For this report, a $b$-jet efficiency rate of
70\% is used, which corresponds to a BDT cut value of 0.8244. This efficiency
rate originates from samples of simulated $t\bar t$ events with a $c$- and
light-jet rejection factor of nearly 400\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-012}. At these
cuts, most of the $c$-jets and light-flavoured jets gets rejected, while still
maintaining most of the $b$-jet data.

\section{Data Analysis}
% TODO:
% Add plot for top mass / W mass
% Måske sæt overflow ind i costheta plot

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:results}
In order to identify the top-quark-pair production, as seen in
figure~\ref{fig:feynmandiagram}, several cuts in the data were implemented. The
criteria are as follows~\cite{oreach2020}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Only one electron or muon in the final state with $p_{T} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Electrons are required to have $|\eta| < 2.47$ aside from $1.37 < |\eta| < 1.52$
    \item Muons are limited by $|\eta| < 2.50$
  \end{itemize}
  \item Missing transverse momentum $E_{T}^{miss} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$
  \item Transverse mass of the W-boson $M_{T}^{W} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$
  \item At least four jets with $p_{T} > 30 \mathrm{GeV}$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$, with
        exactly two of these being b-tagged
\end{itemize}

ROOT defines the function \texttt{SetPtEtaPhiE}, which is used in accordance to
section \ref{sec:momentum} as seen in equation \eqref{eq:TLorentz}.
% The function, which ROOT uses to construct the Lorentz vector,
% \texttt{SetPtEtaPhiE}, is defined as such,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:TLorentz}
p({\vb p_t}, \eta, \phi, E) =
\begin{pmatrix}
|{\vb p_t}| \cos(\phi)\\ |{\vb p_t}|\sin(\phi)\\ |{\vb p_t}| \sinh(\eta)\\ E
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
%To calculate the
%transverse energy we are using the builtin ROOT \texttt{TLorentzVector} member
%function \texttt{Et()}. That function is effectively defined as
%\begin{equation}
% {{{\it p\_t}\,\sqrt{{\it p\_y}^2+{\it p\_x}^2}}\over{\sqrt{ {\it p\_z}^2+{\it p\_y}^2+{\it p\_x}^2}}}
%E_t = p_t \frac{\sqrt{p_y^2+p_x^2}}{\sqrt{p_z^2+p_y^2+p_x^2}}
%\end{equation}

Only a single lepton should be present in the events, after the identification
of top-quark pair production. This allows the first lepton in the event to
be used as the leading lepton. Due to the nature of the decay, described in
Section~\ref{sec:coupling}, the tagged lepton can be either an electron or a
muon. This information is used in the construction of the Lorentz vector for the
lepton, from which the transverse momentum is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:leppt}.\\

In the ATLAS Open Data, the reconstruction of the tracks, and calculation of the
transverse momentum of jets, is already given. The jets in the event are
ordered, which provides information about the leading jet simply by accessing
the first one. Good jets are decided on the requirements given in
Section~\ref{sec:results}, and the momentum plotted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:jetpt}. \\% also a requirement on pseudorapidity
% of the jets to be less than 2.5, however this should probably be mentioned in
% the criteria

The missing transverse energy, $E_T^{miss}$, is also given, calculated by
consideration of momentum conservation, in accordance with what is described in
Section~\ref{sec:transmomentum}. The missing transverse energy is then plotted
if the given event satisfies all the criteria given in
Section~\ref{sec:results}. The energy was plotted in the appropriate units in
Figure~\ref{fig:etmiss}.\\

% maybe explain why maxing Pt gives the lower three jets but seems a bit
% obvious: if the b-jet in the upper part was in the combination it would
% subtract from the transverse momentum because it was produced from the top
% quark which has opposite momentum from the anti top quark.
The top quark mass can be calculated by finding the combination of three jets,
of which one is a $b$-jet, with the highest transverse momentum, and taking the
mass of the whole three jet system. This is a utilization of the hypothesis,
that these three jets are the ones produced by the $\overline{t}$-quark in the
lower part of the Feynman diagram seen in Figure~\ref{fig:feynmandiagram}. While
this hypothesis would most likely hold for most events, it is unlikely to hold
for all.
% possible explanation why it works here (see comment above)
Once the top quark mass is found it can be plotted, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:topmass}. The peak of this histogram should then be compared to
the value from the standard model, which is $172.76 \pm 0.30$ GeV\cite{pdg}.

\subsection{$\cos \theta^{*}$ reconstruction}
Reconstruction of $\cos \theta^{*}$ from the data given in the Lorentz 4 vectors, was
accomplished by equation~\eqref{eq:costheta}. Since only two $b$-jets is tagged,
the $b$-jet associated with the leptonic decay was decided by the method of
exclusion, once the $b$-jet associated with the other jets was identified. The
reconstructed $\cos \theta^{*}$ is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:costhetaatlas} below.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/hist_costheta}
  \caption{\label{fig:costhetaatlas}Reconstructed $\cos \theta^{*}$ from ATLAS data.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Angular Asymmetries}
% TODO:
% Kilde til konstant selection ratio?
For measurements of angular asymmetries $A_{\pm}$ from equation
\eqref{eq:asymmetries}, the $\cos\theta^{*}$ distribution was split into three
non-uniform bins with events above and below $z_{\pm} = \pm(1-2^{\frac{2}{3}})$
given by; $N_1 = N(\cos \theta^{*}<z_-)$, $N_3 = N(\cos \theta^{*}>z_+)$ and $N_2$ being
the remaining events. The true $\cos\theta^*$ distribution has a constant selection ratio over all angles $\cos\theta^*$, and the simulated $\cos\theta^*$ distribution does not. Therefore the observed ATLAS $\cos\theta^*$ distribution is unfolded by calculating correction factors $c_1$ and $c_3$ for bin $N_1$ and $N_3$ respectively. The correction factors were calculated from the simulated distribution with eq.  \eqref{eq:asymmetries}.

\begin{align}
	A_{+}^{SM} &= \frac{(c_3N_3 + N_2) - c_1N_1}{c_1N_1 + N_2 + c_3N_3} \\
	A_{-}^{SM} &= \frac{c_3N_3 - (c_1N_1 + N_2)}{c_1N_1 + N_2 + c_3N_3}
\end{align}
Solving for the correction factors the following values are obtained.
\begin{align}
	c_1 &=  \num{3.037 +- 0.043} \\ c_3 &= \num{2.720 +- 0.118}
\end{align}

These correction factors obtained from simulation is then applied to the
$\cos\theta^{*}$ distribution from the ATLAS data.

Leading to the angular asymmetries $A_- = -0.828 \pm 0.006$ and
$A_+ = 0.521 \pm 0.006$, resulting in the helicity fractions
$F_0=0.634 \pm 0.016$, $F_L=0.339 \pm 0.009$ and $F_R=0.026 \pm 0.009$.

%TODO Error

\subsection{Template Method}
Pythia was used to generate three files containing left, longitudinal and
right-handed polarizations of the W-boson separately. These files were then run
through Delphes, which simulates the ATLAS detector response and uses that to
reconstruct the particles. Cuts were applied in ROOT matching the event
selection criteria defined in section \ref{sec:results} to filter out background
data. The templates were then combined and fitted to the real $\cos \theta^{*}$
distribution from the ATLAS detector, giving us the three helicity fractions
$F_L$, $F_R$ and $F_0$.

\subsection{Delphes data}
Before the criteria from Section~\ref{sec:results} were applied to the Delphes
data, a sanity check was performed on the generated truth data, to assess
whether it matches with the theoretical analytical function plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:distributions}. The three plots are displayed below for each of
the three polarizations in Figures~\ref{fig:delphesdist}.\\

To reconstruct the helicity distributions which would be found from
measurements, the criteria performed on the ATLAS data, from

\section{Discussion}
% TODO:
% Error propagation
The 13 TeV Open Datasets did not simulate polarizations of the $W$ boson,
leading to the utilization of Delphes, in getting polarization distributions to
fit to the reconstructed $\cos \theta^{*}$ data. However, perhaps the greatest source
of errors is a consequence of statistical errors, due to the small event samples
surviving the cut on the given Delphes data, where less than 1/20 of the events
survives the cuts from truth to reconstructed. This results in much more
statistic from the ATLAS data, than from the Delphes simulations. The
uncertainties on the helicity fractions only take error associated with the
statistical fluctuations of the Atlas data into consideration, therefore the
uncertainties presented are greatly underestimated.\\ %noget om at forsøge at estimere højere usikkerheder

From Fig. ??, it is illustrated that the efficiency is not flat as a function of
$\cos \theta^{*}$, but has lower effeciency in $\cos \theta^{*} < z_+$. This possible
originates from the criteria on lepton tagging, where it is required that they
appear isolated in the detector. At $\cos \theta^{*} \rightarrow -1$, the $b$ quark and the
lepton is moving in the same direction, making it impossible to detect the
lepton, and erasing the event from the single lepton
channel.\\ %skal også beskrive den anden figur med 2d smear

Since Delphes runs a fast-simulation, it is not designed to be used in parallel
with data taken from advanced detector studies. This analysis could consequently
serve as a test for this novel approach of combining Delphes simulations with
data taken from ATLAS detector, but the great statistical uncertainty, due to
the low number of simulated events, makes any reasonable conclusion on this
approach impossible. Instead, as a result of time constraints, and the large
storage space required to simulate a sufficient number of Delphes events,
information about the $W$ polarization was obtained by the method of angular
asymmetries, described in Section~\ref{sec:coupling}.\\

Measurements using angular asymmetries were more accurate with less statistical
errors, due to the fact that the data was taken exclusively from the Open ATLAS
Data, which had a much larger data sample than the Delphes simulations. This
allowed for a more confident evaluation of the $W$ boson's helicity fractions.\\



%Det her skal nok stå et sted i Delphes delen, hvis det skal stå et sted
%While similar cuts was attempted to be implemented on the Delphes'
%truth-information, due to the absence of the b-tagging MV2c10 algorithm in
%Delphes, cuts were made using
%80--85\% efficiency instead~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-11-004}.\\




%Forklaring om overflow, ved ikke hvor meget der er relevant.
%The reconstructed $\cos \theta^*$, from the ATLAS data, used in both methods, had
%significant entries in overflow. The theoretical $\cos \theta^*$ was compared to the
%approximation, but no significant differences appeared between the two, refuting
%the possibility that overflow stemmed from the approximation.
%This %ved ikke om vi overhovedet bør nævne det med den sammenligningen.
%overflow was ignored in the fitting process, as only data remaining within the
%physically possible range from -1 to 1, was considered in the analysis. The
%Delphes data for the helicity distributions, had substantially less overflow,
%than data from Open ATLAS, which also motivated the decision to only fit within
%the parameter -1 to 1.

%error propagation, skal nok stå lidt mere om
%For measurements of angular asymmetries, the error was found, using first order
%error propagation on equation~\eqref{eq:asymmetries}.

%Noget om statistical uncertainty, kan måske skrives som en kort kommentar i
%analysen.
%Due to the limitations of the Open Atlas
%Data~\cite{oreach2020}, only statistical uncertainties were considered, leaving
%the possibility of larger systematic uncertainties.

\section{Conclusion}
A measurement of the polarization of $W$ bosons, from top quark pair events
decay to single lepton channels, was presented using data collected from Open
ATLAS $pp$ collision at $\sqrt s = 13$TeV, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 10 fb$^{-1}$. The helicity fractions obtained from angular
asymmetries are $F_0=0.695 \pm 0.015$, $F_L=0.297 \pm 0.008$ and
$F_R=0.007 \pm 0.009$. These results are in agreement with the NNLO QCD
predictions.
